    <h1 id="summary">What is the HIF?</h1>

    <p>
      The Health Impact Fund is intended to provide a complementary system for
      the development of pharmaceutical innovations â€“ especially ones intended
      for poor patients who cannot afford expensive medicines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How does it work?</strong>
      The Health Impact Fund will be financed by states and charitable
      foundations. It would give pharmaceutical innovators the option of
      registering any new product for annual reward payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prices</strong>
      The price of any product registered with the HIF is limited to the costs
      of manufacture and distribution, and therefore affordable even for poor
      patients. The price of registered medicines is delinked from their R&D
      cost. One way to keep prices down is to enable generic manufacturers to
      compete in producing and selling registered drugs.

      <br />
      Usually, once drugs become generic, prices fall substantially since
      generic manufacturers compete to sell identical products. Generic
      competition may not work in all situations, so the HIF might use other
      tools to ensure low prices, including tendering or regulated prices.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Reward payments</strong>
      <br />
      The reward payments received by pharmaceutical innovators depend solely on
      the annual health gains achieved by their registered medicines. The more
      such a new medicine improves or lengthens human lives, the more money goes
      to its innovator.

      <br />
      An important part of the HIF model is that the HIF should pay out a fixed
      amount in every year. Registered products obtain a share of the fixed
      payout equal to their share of assessed health impact of all registered
      products annually. Thus, firms are essentially competing to improve human
      health. A product that had a Having a fixed total payout divided between
      firms helps the HIF (and funders) to manage its budget. Each registered
      product would be eligible for ten years of payments, which resembles the
      duration of exclusivity that firms now enjoy for patented pharmaceuticals.
      Following the 10 years, products would be required to be licensed for
      generic production.
