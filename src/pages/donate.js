    <h2>Why your donation is important for global health</h2>

    <p>
      The Health Impact Fund offers a unique model to achieve big gains in
      global health. We are working hard to bring it to reality but we need your
      help! Incentives for Global Health is a registered charity with 501(c)(3)
      status in the US â€” so we will be happy to send you a personal thank you
      and a tax receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the remainder of 2020, an anonymous donor has offered to match
      donations made through this website one for one, so you can effectively
      double your donation.
    </p>
    <p>If you can, we urge you to donate monthly.</p>
