    "hif_description": "There is a market failure in drug development mainly suffered by poor people. The Health Impact Fund creates new incentive systems for the development of innovative pharmaceuticals that decouple the price of drugs from the cost of research.",
    "hif_tagline": "Decouple the price of drugs from the cost of research.",
    "step_01": "The Health Impact Fund distributes each year a fixed pool of reward money supplied by states and charitable funders.",
    "step_02": "Pharmaceutical innovators register certain new products with the Health Impact Fund – often ones they would otherwise not have developed – and thereby commit to selling them at the cost of manufacture and distribution.",
    "step_03": "The Health Impact Fund assesses the registered drugs and measures to what extent they lengthen lives and improve health. It rewards products according to their health gains.",
    "step_04": "Because drugs registered with the Health Impact Fund are sold without markup, they can produce rewardable health gains even among the poor. Wealthier countries that contribute to the Health Impact Fund enjoy the same low prices. Moreover, all patients benefit when innovators are paid not merely for selling such drugs but according to their therapeutic benefits.",
    "step_05": "We cannot do it without your help! We hope you will collaborate with us in refining and implementing the Health Impact Fund idea so that new medicines can really benefit all."

His research deals with the immunological and biochemical basis of host defense. He established that lymphocyte products activate macrophages, that interferon-gamma is a major macrophage activating factor, and that mechanisms of macrophage antimicrobial activity include induction of the respiratory burst and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). He and his colleagues purified, cloned, knocked out and characterized iNOS biochemically and functionally, discovered the cofactor role of tetrahydrobiopterin in NOS’s and introduced iNOS as a therapeutic target. Although iNOS helps the host control Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the leading cause of death from bacterial infection, Mtb resists sterilization by host immunity. Nathan’s lab now focuses on the biochemical basis of this resistance. Genetic and chemical screens have identified enzymes that Mtb requires to survive during non-replicative persistence, including the mycobacterial proteasome and components of pyruvate dehydrogenase that serve in peroxynitrite reductase.
